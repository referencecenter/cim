## Summary

Finds possible references to the AAMC program Careers in Medicine

## Background

The [Association of American Medical Colleges](https://www.aamc.org 'Tomorrow\'s Doctors, Tomorrow\'s Cures | AAMC') (AAMC) has a program called [Careers in MedicineÂ®](https://www.aamc.org/cim/ 'Home | Careers in Medicine') (CiM), which used to be called MedCAREERS. The programs in this repository were born out of a need to find references to CiM. Many instances of the phrase \"careers in medicine\" are not in reference to the AANC program. Case-sensitive searching could weed out many false positives, but most research databases and search engines are not case sensitive. These programs were designed to make it easier to go through search results and to identify which matches of search terms are more likely to be true positives and which are more likely to be false positives. It does so using regular expressions, so these programs could be adapted to locate other case-sensitive terms.
